# Librabry_Management_system-(lab8)
Data Collections: Mini Project
I want to create a simple library management system. Let's call it LMS.

Key things to handle:
❖ Borrowing
❖ Returning
❖ Inventory

A person should be able to borrow a book and the inventory should reflect
this. The same applies to returning.

For inventory, I want to have the title of the book and the count. The
library manager should be able to add more books to the inventory

Extra: I can track who is borrowing books using their ID number. So I
should be able to know who has what books.
